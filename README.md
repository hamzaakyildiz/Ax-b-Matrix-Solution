# Ax-b-Matrix-Solution

Solving a given set of linear equations.

First determines the following conditions;
* If 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝐴) = 𝑛, then it finds the unique solution and additionally, it also finds 𝐴^−1.

* If 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝐴) = 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝐴|𝑏) < 𝑛, then it gives an arbitrary solution.

* If 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝐴) < 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝐴|𝑏), then it only states that the problem has no solution at all.

# Input Format
The first number in .txt files gives the number 𝑛. Then, there is a 𝑛 x (𝑛 + 1) matrix which represents the augmented matrix [𝐴|𝑏].
